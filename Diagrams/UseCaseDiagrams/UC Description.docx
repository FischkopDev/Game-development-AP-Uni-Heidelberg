The main character is called Steve and he's a divorced man who has psychological problems.
In the first scene he wakes up on his sofa and the player can interact in first person with items inside the house. 
The player has to accomplish tasks before being able to continue with the story. He has to get dressed, clean the kitchen, pick up a letter laying on the table and finally leave the house and drive to the city to work by clicking on the house door.

For the second scene the player will be teleported into the office and is able to sit down at his desk.

As the third scene starts the player is now at his desk where he can start to work by clicking on the computer. Thatâ€™s also where Steve will fall asleep.

In the fourth scene the player first has to enter his house and follow a mostly strict order of tasks which trigger new events.
First he has to enter the house and then explore the kitchen where he will see various optical illusions and figures moving around the house.
He will then has to go into the bedroom where he goes to bed and wakes up at his desk again. This leads to scene 5.

The fifth scene only consists of a cut scene where it is shown that Steve wakes up on his desk while his boss is yelling at him. The cut scene slowly blacks out and the game is finished.
