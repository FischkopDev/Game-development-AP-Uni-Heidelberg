The main character is called Steve and he's a divorced man who has psychological problems. 
In the first scene he wakes up on his sofa and the player can interact in first person with items inside the house.
The player has to accomplish tasks before being able to continue with the story. He has to get dressed, take out the
trash, clean the kitchen, pick up a letter laying on the floor and finally leave the house and drive to the city to work
by clicking on the car.

For the second scene the player will be teleported into the office and again is able to accomplish optional tasks such as 
listening to complaining boss by stepping in front of the boss's door, using the restroom or sitting down at his desk,
which allows the story to continue.

As the third scene starts the player is now in the dream world but still in his office where he again has to do some mini
tasks that have not been specified yet, but definitely clocking out and leaving the office via the elevator.

In the fourth scene the player first has to enter his house and follow a mostly strict order of tasks which trigger new events.
First he has to click on a painting hanging on the wall which will turn on the TV. The TV has to be turned off and after that the 
player has to pick up a letter laying on the sofa which triggers chairs, that have been hanging on the ceiling all the time, to fall 
down and a window to start slamming loudly. The player has to close the slamming window and is somehow led to the 
bedroom where a women is laying in bed. He has to click on the women which will trigger an event where a women is slamming
on the window and the player has to escape into the restroom and pick up the restroom key and lock the door.
After that he has to run outside of the house which will lead to scene 5.

The fifth scene only consists of a cut scene where it is shown that Steve wakes up on his desk while his boss is yelling at
him. The cut scene slowly blacks out and the game is finished.
