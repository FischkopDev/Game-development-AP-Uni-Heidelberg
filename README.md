# Kenopsia - A psychological horror game
The story of Steve is a story-driven psychological horror game that is as close to reality as possible, putting the player in the role of Steve - a man in the midst of a personal crisis. Accompanied through the day and his nightmarish experiences, the player delves deep into Steve's reality and his fragile psyche.
The working name of the game is “GetOut”  

Purpose of the system is to create an immersive, terrifying experience for the player. The system encompasses various components, each serving a specific purpose to enhance the horror elements.

## Project structure
The Unity Engine is used for the development of the game. A TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach is applied. Programming takes place on the development branch and is merged into the main branch only for runnable versions or important milestones. Additionally, there is a programming-idea branch where we develop prototypes and merge them with the development branch if they are deemed useful.  

In this git repo you'll find the following folders with functionality described below

### Assets
This folder contains all 3D objects, textures, materials, etc. There is also a file where credits for the authors are noted so they can be mentioned in the game later.

### Design Scenes
This folder contains all the conceptual designs for the scenes. This includes drawings and descriptions. The scene, once created as a 3D object, will be stored directly in the Unity project folder.

### Diagrams
Contains all diagrams that describe the game. This includes all types of diagrams such as class diagrams, state machines, etc.

### Unity Project
The Unity project is stored here. If assets are used for a specific scene, they can be placed directly in this folder and deleted from the Assets folder to avoid duplicates.
